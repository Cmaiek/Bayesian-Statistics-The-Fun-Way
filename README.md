**Bayesian Statistics The Fun Way by Will Kurt** is a fantastic book about the Bayesian approach for everyone interested in Data Science, and I highly recommend reading it. 

With that being said,  many readers that are familiar with Python can be disappointed that the author is using the R language to explain the concepts and solve exercises. If you would like to follow the book using Python, you can now do that by looking at the materials that I have shared. Please note that not for all chapters programming software is required, so that is why my repository includes only selected chapters.
